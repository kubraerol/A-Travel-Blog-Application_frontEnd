# Travel Blog App - Frontend 

The project is a work done within the scope of term paper. Within the scope of the project, I worked on story board creation, functional decomposition, state diagram creation, sequence diagram creation and front-end development of the application. In this repository, I share the storyboard and the codes I created for frontend development.
(Backend services, mockups and requirement analysis were created by my group friend. I just wanted to include my own work in this repository.)


You can find the story board and images of the project below.The application was developed in Turkish language.
